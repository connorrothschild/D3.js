			  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump all day</p>&mdash; ye (@kanyewest) <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1080199325295071233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

		   <p class="prose"> Detractors to Trump's use of Twitter include his wife Melania, who, when asked about the one habit she wished he'd give up, <a href="https://youtu.be/7oW-Z1a7iRs?t=426"  target="_blank">responded</a>, "The tweeting." They include Chief of Staff John Kelly, part of whose job is to impose order on the documents and news articles that reach Trump's desk, which include inflammatory content created by members of the alt-right that he has read and retweeted.</p>
  
		   <p class="prose"> Yet in spite of the critics from the left and from his own circle, Trump has continued to tweet. He has used it has a platform to speak to and connect with voters; when he tweets, people know they're hearing directly from him. He has used it as a weapon, intimidating rivals and throwing off critics. But most importantly, he has used it to capture the attention of voters bombarded by a dizzying array of information. With a couple taps, Trump generates the news. He drives the conversation. He is always in control of the storyline. </p> -->

				<h2> The AFINN Lexicon</h2>
						<p class="prose">
				The technique I have used here uses a list of words (from -5 to 5) scored by <a href="http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010">Finn Årup Nielsen</a> to measure positive and negative emotions present in language. Trump tweets in short, punchy sentences with 
			  a relatively small vocabulary, which is perfect, because the technique relies on words in the data source to match up with words in the scored words document. Trump's favorite words like <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/266254611919282177?lang=en" target="_blank">great</a>, <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/donald-trump-s-sad-tweets" target="_blank">sad</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/752110630031749120" target="_blank">weak</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/950103659337134080?lang=en" target="_blank">fake</a> are each assigned a value, then aggregated with the values of the other words in the tweet. </p>

			   <h2> The Phone Switch</h2>
						<p class="prose">
				Data from Twitter conveniently includes a column about what kind of device the tweets come from, whether it's a desktop client, iPhone, Android, or another platform. Despite receiving a new secure, encrypted, Secret Service-approved device a day before his inauguration, Trump was notoriously attached to his personal Android phone, a Samsung Galaxy, the device from which he sent most of his own tweets and which his top aides feared was a security risk. "That Android has a microphone, which means that it can be turned into a room bug without anyone’s knowledge," explained security expert Bruce Schneieer. These are all of his tweets before he made the switch.</p>
  
			  
					</section>
			 
					<section class="step">
	 
					  <p class="prose">On March 8, tweets from the Android device mysteriously stopped, prompting people to wonder if he had finally given it up. Their speculations were confirmed when the White House Director of Social Media <a href=" https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/846918912793083904">made the announcement</a> on Twitter. But people had already figured out which tweets were composed by Trump himself and which were by his staff. According to David Robinson's <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/">analysis</a>, "Android tweets are angrier and more negative, while the iPhone tweets tend to be benign announcements and pictures."</p>
					</section>
				<section class="step">
	  
						 <p class="prose">Both his staff and Trump's own tweets now come from an iPhone, making it difficult to tell who tweeted what. However, using data under the assumption that Android tweets were from Trump himself and iPhone tweets from his staff, a data scientist created <a href="http://didtrumptweetit.com/">DidTrumpTweetIt</a>, training a machine learning model to classify whether his current tweets are his own or his staff's.</p>

				<section class="step">
			 <h2> On Obama</h2>
						<p class="prose">
				Trump's back and forth with Obama began in March 2011, when Good Morning America interviewed him about running for president, and he claimed that he was skeptical of Obama's citizenship, later demanding to see Obama's birth certificate. Although that issue was put to rest, he frequently tweeted about his dissatisfication with the Obama administration, calling him the "worst president in the history of the United States."</p>
					</section>
				<section class="step">
			 <h2> On Clinton</h2>
						<p class="prose">
			Throughout his campaign and even during his presidency, Trump has taken to Twitter to attack Hillary Clinton, giving her the nickname "Crooked Hillary." </p>
					</section>
				<section class="step">
			 <h2> On the Media</h2>
						<p class="prose">
				Outside of his favorite show Fox &amp; Friends, Trump has made it clear that he is no friend of the media, calling the New York Times and CNN the "failing" New York Times and the "Fake News Network." He has also called the media "dishonest," "corrupt," "disgusting," and above all, "an enemy of the people." In February of 2017, the Trump administration barred the Guardian, the New York Times, Politico, CNN, Buzzfeed, and BBC, among other media outlets from gaining entry to an off-camera press briefing. Although other presidents have had complicated relationhips with the press (Jefferson, Lincoln, Jackson)—the amount of repeated attacks and attempts to discredit it completely—are unprecedented.  </p>

			 <h2> Time of Day</h2>
						<p class="prose">
		The New York Times describes Trump waking up around 5:30 in the morning, "flip[ing] to CNN for news, mov['ing'] to “Fox &amp;Friends” for comfort and messaging ideas, and sometimes watch['ing'] MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” because, friends suspect, it fires him up for the day." The imagery of Trump still in bed propped up by his pillow, tweeting manically, is rich. </p>
					</section>
			<section class="step">
			  <p class="prose">
	   Many of Trump's tweets are concentrated between 6:00-9:00 in the morning, and it's no coincidence that this overlaps with the time slot for the Fox &amp; Friends.  </p>
			</section>
			 
				<section class="step">
						<p class="prose">
			   When filtering for tweets from an Android device, most of these tweets were made early in the morning.  This also confirms that the angrier tweets are from an Android device, and therefore written by Trump himself .</p>
					</section>
  
				<section class="step">
		
						<p class="prose">
		On the other hand, his staff's tweets typically came from later in the evening and were more positive.</p>
					</section>
				<section class="step">
			<h2> A Timeline</h2>
						<p class="prose">
				Trump's sentiment also changes over time. During and following the 2016 election, his tweets were largely positive, celebrating his victory and signaling optimism for his presidency. Immediately after taking office, however, around late January and early February, Trump went on the defensive, defending his positions on illegal immigration and terrorism while attacking the media.

				<p class="prose">
		  So what have we learned about Trump and his Twitter habit? Many of his tweets—especially ones that are congratulatory or thanking someone—are not his own, and made later in the day. He, on the other hand, prefers to tweet on his Android device in the morning, from the comfort of his own bed, fired up from his daily morning dose of cable news. </p>
  
		  <p class="prose">
			Although sentiment analysis is not completely accurate in capturing all of the nuances of Trump's language, it does a good job of parsing his emotional state at a given time and his attitude toward a certain person or subject. Moreover, as he continues to tweet, sentiment can be used in tandem with other features of natural language in machine learning determine whether a certain tweet was even his own.</p>

	  <h2> Credits </h2>
	  <p class="prose"> Tweet data comes from the <a href="http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/">Trump Twitter Archive</a>. The data was collected on January 25, 2017. I filtered out tweets that began with a quote or "RT" so that I would keep only tweets containing Trump's own language. The whole dataset was then filtered for his most retweeted tweets. Inspiration for the visualization go to <a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/01/chyrons/">Charlie Smart</a> of The Pudding. I used <a href="/">Dremio</a> to do the <a href="/tutorials/tweet-sentiment-sql/">sentiment analysis</a>.
